# Generates some test curves
Generates some test curves using Python 3.0

# How to convert number of samples to time?
NS = SD*FS - 1 \
SD being signal duration in [s] \
FS being sampling frequency in [Hz] \
NS being number of samples

# Specs
Made with Python 3.6.1 \
Depends on: numpy 1.12.1 and matplotlib 2.0.2
